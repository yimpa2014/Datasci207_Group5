Final Project

The goal of the project is to perform an end to end dataset analysis (data cleaning, model training, hyperparameter selection, model evaluation).
You can select a dataset for your project by browsing:

The UCI Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com
Ensure that the dataset you sourced does not contain personal identifiable information and is not a synthetic dataset. Make sure you understand how the dataset was collected (e.g. is it scraped from the web? Is it based on human or automatic annotation?)
For the final project you will form a group of 3 or 4 people. Your group can only include members from the section in which you are enrolled. You will pick your own dataset (each group should have a different dataset). You will present your final project in class during the final session (for ~ 15 min).
